# Andrés Gorzelany - @get-itips

Hi! :wave: I am Andrés Gorzelany, I am a Computer Science Engineer and I consider myself an IT Senior Consultant.
I am a [@MicrosoftDocs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/) collaborator, I mostly respond to issues that users create against the Microsoft Docs articles, create pull requests and also review them.
I am Argentinian and I moved to Costa Rica  recently.

I love to travel and specially I love to attend conferences and meet new people from around the world. :earth_americas: :earth_asia: :earth_africa:
